Automate the process of obtaining free Instagram followers using Mr. Insta

- The `MrInsta.login` function may occasionally fail even with correct credentials due to server issues, especially if there are too many accounts. 

- Create fake users in [https://app.mrinsta.com](https://app.mrinsta.com/) then copy to `users.json`
- Update your `.env` file
- Update your `main.py/TARGET`

- `CreateAccounts`

  - The process of bypassing OTP and creating accounts can be automated, but we are currently unable to automate Instagram verification. However, we have a solution suggested by @Emotulgaa, which involves using a list of existing accounts in the followers.txt file. This method can be time-consuming, as some of the accounts in the list may already be taken by @Emotulgaa or @ByamB4.
